- **AI Implementation Complexity**: RAG implementation may be challenging with beginner AI skills
- **Narrower Use Case**: Limited to writing tasks rather than general productivity

## Selection Decision: QuestFlow

After careful evaluation, **QuestFlow** emerges as the most promising micro-app idea for development. Here's the detailed justification:

### Primary Justification Factors

1. **Strongest Skill Alignment**: QuestFlow makes optimal use of Sasha's advanced storytelling skills and intermediate game design experience, allowing for the creation of a truly unique product that leverages core strengths.

This creates a significant opportunity for innovation.

3. **Direct Target Audience Alignment**: QuestFlow directly addresses the primary target audience of individuals seeking productivity enhancements who benefit from structured approaches and/or have executive function challenges.

4. **Balanced Technical Complexity**: While implementing game mechanics and narrative elements presents some challenges, they align well with Sasha's existing skills, making the technical complexity manageable within the 4-6 week timeframe.
